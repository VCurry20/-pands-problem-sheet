# Task 1  - BMI


> File - [BMI.py](https://github.com/VCurry20/-pands-problem-sheet/blob/main/BMI.py)

> Objective - Write a program that calculates a person's BMI

> Input - Person's height in Centimetres and weight in Kilograms

> Output - BMI - weight divided by height in metres SQ


## Code:

```ruby
name = input ('Enter your name: ')                                          
print('Hello ' + name + '\nNice to meet you, lets calculate your BMI!')     

height = float(input('Enter your height in CM: '))                          
heightinmeters = height / 100                                              
print('Your height in meters is {}'.format(heightinmeters))                 

weight = float(input("Input your weight in Kilogram: "))                    
print('Your weight is {}'.format(weight))                                   

BMI = (round(weight / (heightinmeters * heightinmeters), 2))                
print ( " Your BMI is {}".format (BMI)) 
```

This code asks the user to input their name and greets them. The user is then asked for their height and weight and from this the program calculates their BMI. BMI formula (weight / (height * height), 2)

# Task 2  - Second String


> File - [secondstring.py](https://github.com/VCurry20/-pands-problem-sheet/blob/main/secondstring.py)

> Objective - Write a program that asks for a input and outputs every second letter in reverse

> Input - The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

> Output - .o zletrv pu o wr cu h


## Code:

```ruby
phrase = input ( "Please submit a phrase: ")                                            
print ( "Your phrase is: " + phrase +"\nWe will now return this reverted")              

print ( "Your phrase reverted is: " + (phrase[::-1]))                                  

print ( "Your phrase revert and missing every second letter is: " + (phrase[::-2]))
```

This code asks the user for an input - example " The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." . The program reverts this input and returns the sentence missing every second letter - example output ".o zletrv pu o wr cu h". This program uses slicing and also reversing.

# Task 3  - Collatz


> File - [collatz.py](https://github.com/VCurry20/-pands-problem-sheet/blob/main/collatz.py)

> Objective - Write a program that asks users to input a positive integer and outputs a list of successive values - successive values calculated as follows - if even divide by two, if odd multiply by three and add one. Program stops at zero.

> Input - 10

> Output - 10,5,16,8,4,2,1


## Code:

```ruby
def formula (number):                                           
    if (number % 2) == 0:                                       
        return int(number / 2)                                  
   
    else:                                                       
        return int( (number * 3) + 1)                           


number = int (input("Please enter a positive integer:"))        

print(number)                                                   
while(number !=1):                                              
        number = formula (number)                               
        print (number)                                          

print(number)                                                   
```
In this program a formula is definied; this checks if the number is even - if even it divides by 2, if not it is odd and therefore it is multiplied by 3 and 1 is added to it.
From this formula numbers are then passed through - each number is printed to the variable and returned as an output at the end of the program.

# Task 4  - Weekday


> File - [weekday.py](https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/pands-problems/blob/master/weekday.py)

> Objective - Write a program that outputs whether today is a weekday or not.

> Input - Any day of the week - for example Monday

> Output - For the weekdays; " Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday.", for the Weekend days; " It is the Weekend, Yay!".


## Code:

```ruby
import datetime                                                                           
weeknumber = datetime.datetime.today().weekday()

week = ("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday","Saturday","Sunday")      


def whichdayisit (weekday):                                                               
    
    for weekday in range (0,4):                                                           
        return ("Yes, unfortunately it's a weekday")                                      

    else:                                                                                 
        for weekday in range (5,6):                                                                               
            return ("It is the weekend, yay!")                                            


day = input ("Please enter a day of the week: ")                                          
print (whichdayisit (day))                                                                
```
In this program the user is asked to input a day and it returns if it is a weekend or not. The program workds from a predefined formula, which uses the imported datetime module.

    while x - y > e:                     
          x = (x + y) / 2                
          y = number/x                   
    print (round(x,2))

# Task 6  - 


> File - [es.py](https://github.com/VCurry20/-pands-problem-sheet/blob/main/es.py)

> Objective - Write a program that reads in a TXT file and output the number of "e"'s it contains

> Input - Ulysses by James Joyce

> Output - 141150


## Code:

```ruby
import sys                         

with open (sys.argv[1]) as f:       
    data = f.read()                 
    freq = data.count("e")          
    print (freq)                   


## Run file by python typing >  es.py Ulysses.txt  < the in command line ##
```
This program uses the imported System module to access outside files, it then accesses a txt document containing Ulysses by James Joyce. The txt.file is reviewed for "e"'s and the number of "e"'s is returned to the user.
