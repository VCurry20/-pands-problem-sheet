# Week 4 Task

# Write a program that asks the user to input a positive integer 
# outputs successive values 

# @ each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and if even - divide by 2 / if odd multiple by three and add one

# Please enter a positive integer:  10
# result: 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1


# rules like grading ?
# loops until it gets to an end point
